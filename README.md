# Green Meter App ðŸŒ±

**Green Meter App** is a web-based carbon footprint calculator that estimates and optimizes COâ‚‚ emissions based on activity data and adjustable sliders.

## Features
This app allows users to enter activity data for various categories including cars, buses, trucks, cargo planes, heating, cooling, lighting, computing electricity, forklifts, and subcontractors. Adjustable sliders let users simulate emission reductions through EV adoption, trip sharing, and plane load factor optimization. The app calculates baseline and optimized COâ‚‚ emissions and displays results through interactive bar and pie charts for easy visualization and analysis.

## Technologies
- HTML

## Usage
1. Enter activity data in numeric fields
2. Adjust sliders for EV share, KM reduction, and plane load factor
3. View baseline and optimized COâ‚‚ emissions on charts
